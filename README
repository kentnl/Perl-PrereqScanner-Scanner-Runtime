Perl::PrereqScanner::Scanner::Runtime

This distribution contains a collection of various run-time scanners,
intended to expose "optional" prerequisites to tools that are expressly
looking for them.

Grading them as optional is presently an exercise left to the user.

This class is a convenience wrapper around a bunch of other classes that
provide different kinds of generic "Runtime" detection.

*   "Module::Runtime"

    Scans for "Module::Runtime" specific syntax.

*   "Class::Load"

    Scans for "Class::Load" specific syntax.
