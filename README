Perl::PrereqScanner::Scanner::Runtime

This distribution contains a collection of various run-time scanners,
intended to expose "optional" prerequisites to tools that are expressly
looking for them.

Grading them as optional is presently an exercise left to the user.

This class is a convenience wrapper around a bunch of other classes that
provide different kinds of generic "Runtime" detection.

*   "Module::Runtime"

    Scans for "Module::Runtime" specific syntax.

*   "Class::Load"

    Scans for "Class::Load" specific syntax.

*   "Module::Load"

    Scans for "Module::Load" specific syntax.

  AUDIENCE

Its worth noting that this module is not necessarily going to be useful
in part of a "Dist::Zilla" or similar stack. By nature of how this
works, its job is to find dependencies that likely qualify as
*optional*.

Hence, blindly advertising what this scanner reports as dependencies is
not recommended.

This tool is more oriented around turn-key maintainers who want a quick
way of finding *possible* auto-magical dependency behavior so they can
make judgment calls about it.
